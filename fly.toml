# Restart policy guidance:
# Fly ephemeral deployer machines used for building have restart_policy=no by design.
# App machines are controlled via the platform and will be restarted according to
# the platform's configuration; keeping `auto_stop_machines=false` ensures your
# app machines remain available and are managed by Fly's VM lifecycle.

# You can add secrets with: flyctl secrets set KEY=value
# Example:
# flyctl secrets set JWT_SECRET=super-secret SENSAY_ORGANIZATION_SECRET=abc123

# To deploy:
# flyctl deploy --image-label $(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
